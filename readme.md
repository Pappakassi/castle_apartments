# Castle Apartments

A real estate listing web application built with Django for the final project in the "Verklegt námskeið II" course.

## Project Overview

Castle Apartments is a platform for listing, browsing, and managing apartment listings and purchase offers. The application includes user roles for buyers and sellers, and supports multi-step offer finalization, filtering, and user interaction features.

- **Create New Apartment**: Logged-in sellers can create apartment listings through a dedicated form.
- **Edit and Delete Apartments**: Sellers can manage their own listings.
- **Submit Purchase Offer**: Buyers can submit or resubmit offers for an apartment.
- **Offer Filtering and Search**: The offers list supports filtering by status, keywords, and sorting.
- **Favorite Button**: Buyers can favorite apartments and toggle this from the apartment detail page.
- **Sellers List Page**: A public list of all sellers with links to their individual profiles.
- **Seller Profile Page**: Each seller has a profile with information, bio, and a list of their properties.
- **Search and Filtering on Apartments**: The apartment list page supports filtering by street, postal code, type, price, and order.
